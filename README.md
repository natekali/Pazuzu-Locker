# Pazuzu-Locker üëø
Brand new Crypto-Locker made using **Fernet** encryption method, an **automatic parser** go through all the files of the computer target, for **each files**, a **new encryption key** is used, making the forensics investigations **harder**, even **impossible**. At the end of the execution, a **csv file** is created, uploaded to PixelDrain and deleted from the computer. The **only way to decrypt** files is to have the PixelDrain **file ID** necessary to run the `decrypt.py` program. **Pazuzu is 100% automatic**, only changes needed to run properly can be done through `conf.py` file
